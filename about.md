I am a software engineer interested in tackling challenges with new technologies. I enjoy teamwork, collaborating with customers, and assuming responsibilities. I graduated from the Grenoble Institute of Technology in 2017 with a Master of Engineering in signal & image processing, and have been working around the world for embedded software.


## Experience

### International Graduate Consultant
**AKKA Technologies**, Ulm, Germany  
January 2020 - April 2020

* Set-up the cross-compilation environment, revamped the outdated embedded Linux image for ARM-based boards for embedded automotive remote diagnostics
* Customized the Linux image to leverage the hardware (CAN, GPS, cellular network), and enable higher level applications (Java run-time) based on Polarion requirements
* Improved project management, consulting, and innovation skills through AKKA’s internal training program at the AKKAdemy, Geneva, Switzerland

### Field Application Engineer
**Kalray**, Los Altos, CA, USA
